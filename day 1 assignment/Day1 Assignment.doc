1.	Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2
1.HTTP1.1- mainly functions on text format (request and responses are in textual format).
2.HTTP1.1- it compresses its data by itself
3. HTTP1.1-usually it loads the resources one by one hence if one resource is not loaded it blocks every other resource behind it.
4. HTTP1.1-uses requests resource Inlining for getting multiple pages.	

1. HTTP2- functions on binary language
2. HTTP2- it needs HPACK tool for data compression
3. HTTP2- use single TCP connection to send multiple streams of data at once so that no one resource blocks any other resource.
4. HTTP2- PUSH frame is used to collects all multiple pages.

2.	Objects and its internal representation in Javascript

Objects is an important data type in javascript which differs from the primitive’s data types such as number, string, and Boolean. 
It stores many values in form of key: value pairs. 
We can store entire properties of an element we taken in the Object data type. 
Example: var car= {carname: “BMW”, carcolor: “Blue”, Year: 2023}
	Properties are nothing but the named values in JavaScript. 
    There are different methods to create an object
1.	Create a single object, using an object literal.
Example: const Human = {firstName:"Mani", lastName:"K", age:20, eyeColor:"black"};
2.	Create a single object, with the keyword new.
Example: const Human= new Object();
		firstName:"Mani";
		lastName:"K";
		age:20;
		eyeColor:"black";
3.	Create an object using Object.create(). Its same like new Object() instead of new Object() use Object.create().
